1) Write a program which prints the following information about at least 5 persons:
	NAME  MAIL-ID  EMPLOYEE-CODE  PHONE
	Eg. Umesh  umesh@cse  p03161  25764728
	Salil      salil@cse     p03160  25764728
	Each entry should be on a separate line.

2)Write a program that prints the following line on the screen along with quotes.
“Can we print ‘\’ with print() statement?”


3) Create a small program that defines some fields. Try creating some illegal field names and see what kind of error the compiler produces. Use the naming rules and conventions as a guide.

4)In the program you created in Exercise 3, try leaving the fields uninitialized and print out their values. Try the same with a local variable and see what kind of compiler errors you can produce. Becoming familiar with common compiler errors will make it easier to recognize bugs in your code.
